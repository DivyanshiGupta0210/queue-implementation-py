# queue-implementation-py
In this repository, I have performed Queue Implementation in Python using Breadth First Search, which is a level-by-level traversal algorithm used for finding the shortest path of solution. Here, I use traversal to find the shortest path for a game in which we check whether a specified target position falls in the path of a chess Knight or not.
